# Feature Workflow

## Activation Contract

### Use this skill when

- You are given a GitHub issue number or link from `asgard-ai-platform/asgard-sdk-pm`
- You need the full per-issue SDD cycle: resolve → plan → build → review → done

### Do NOT use for

- Small fixes with clear scope that do not trace to a PM issue (edit the file directly)
- Review-only runs (invoke `/review BUILD-NNN` directly instead)
- Issues already planned — check `requirements/tasks/_index.md` first

---

## How it works

This skill is the **per-issue orchestrator** for the asgard-js-sdk SDD process. It operates in **spec-only mode** always (no running design-reference server, no screenshot comparison). The prototype reference under `references/asgard-chat-kit-prototype` is visual / behavioral background only — do not treat it as the implementation spec.

**Lifecycle: Resolve → Plan → [PAUSE] → Build → Review → Done**

**No auto mode.** The skill always pauses after Plan to present the task pair(s) and wait for explicit user confirmation before any implementation begins.

---

## Stage 1: Resolve

**Goal:** Locate and read the PM TASK spec for the given issue.

### Step 1.0 — Refresh design references（每次開工先執行）

在讀取任何 spec 之前，先把 PM spec 與 prototype/design submodule 更新到遠端最新，確保對到的是最新設計：

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote references
```

註：`--remote` 會把 submodule checkout 到遠端最新，父 repo 的 pin 會顯示為已變更。這個 pin bump commit 進 feature 分支**完全無妨、也不影響開發**——`references/` 只是背景參考（不被 app 編譯，實作以 distill 進 `requirements/` 的內容為準），且 CI 未開 `submodules: true`。因此就讓 pin 始終浮到最新、bump 自然留在分支即可，不必刻意避免 commit。

### Step 1.1 — Fetch the issue

```bash
gh issue view <n> -R asgard-ai-platform/asgard-sdk-pm --json title,body,labels
```

Inspect the `body` field for a tracking reference — typically under "相關票" or similar heading. The reference is a path like `tracking/asgard-js-sdk/tasks/TASK-NNN-<slug>.md` (or a `features/F-NNN-*.md` / `use-cases/UC-NNN-*.md` path).

### Step 1.2 — Read the TASK spec

Read `references/asgard-sdk-pm/<that-path>`.

If the file is still not present after Step 1.0's refresh, search by TASK number or title:

```bash
find references/asgard-sdk-pm/tracking/asgard-js-sdk -name "*NNN*.md" 2>/dev/null
# or search by keyword:
grep -rl "<keyword-from-title>" references/asgard-sdk-pm/tracking/asgard-js-sdk/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 1.3 — Resolve Gate

- [ ] Issue title, labels, and body retrieved
- [ ] TASK / feature / use-case spec file path confirmed and file read
- [ ] Acceptance criteria or behavioral requirements identified from the spec

If the spec references other upstream specs under `references/asgard-sdk-pm` (features ↔ use-cases), read those too as background. Do not implement from `references/` directly — the spec must be distilled into `requirements/tasks/` files first.

---

## Stage 2: Plan

**Goal:** Distill the spec into one BUILD + REVIEW pair (or several pairs for large features), create the task files, and PAUSE for user confirmation.

### Step 2.1 — Determine task numbering

Find the next BUILD number from existing files:

```bash
ls requirements/tasks/BUILD-*.md 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1
```

If no BUILD tasks exist yet, start at `BUILD-001`. Otherwise increment the highest number found by 1.

### Step 2.2 — Decide how many BUILD tasks

**Default: one BUILD + one REVIEW pair per issue.**

Split into multiple pairs only when the issue covers two or more clearly separable capabilities (e.g. a core-only stream change AND an independent react template) that cannot reasonably be reviewed together. When in doubt, keep it one pair.

### Step 2.3 — Create BUILD-NNN.md

Copy `requirements/tasks/_build_template.md` to `requirements/tasks/BUILD-NNN-<slug>.md`.

Fill in these fields (remove template HTML comments after filling):

- `Task ID`: `BUILD-NNN`
- `Status`: `draft`
- `Issue`: the GitHub issue URL (`https://github.com/asgard-ai-platform/asgard-sdk-pm/issues/<n>`)
- `Source spec`: the `references/asgard-sdk-pm/tracking/asgard-js-sdk/<path>` spec path
- `Complexity`: `S` (single function / small change) | `M` (standard client method / template) | `L` (cross-package flow or streaming/protocol change)
- `Brief`: 2–5 sentences — the developer-visible outcome and the changed packages / modules / components; note anything that already exists to be reused or extended.
- `Relevant Rules`: the pre-filled table from the template (sourced from `FRONTEND_RULE_COMMON.md`) — do not delete rows; add extra rows if this task involves patterns not in the default table.
- `Acceptance Criteria`: translate the spec's acceptance conditions into EARS `R#` identifiers. Every `R#` must be independently verifiable. The last `R#` is always a build + demo/test smoke check.
- `Implementation Tasks`: ordered `T#` steps mapped to `R#`; include `npm run lint:packages`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm run build:core && npm run build:react` in the pre-done step.
- `Coverage` — both Use Cases and Files: leave as `[filled during build]`.
- `Execution Log`: add `YYYY-MM-DD: BUILD task created from <issue URL> (Status: draft)`.

### Step 2.4 — Create REVIEW-NNN.md

Copy `requirements/tasks/_review_template.md` to `requirements/tasks/REVIEW-NNN-<slug>.md`.

Fill in:

- `Task ID`: `REVIEW-NNN`
- `Status`: `draft`
- `BUILD Task`: `BUILD-NNN`
- Leave `Reviewed commit` and `Reviewed branch` blank — filled at review time.
- `Execution Log`: add `YYYY-MM-DD: REVIEW task created, paired with BUILD-NNN (Status: draft)`.

### Step 2.5 — Register in `_index.md`

Add both tasks to the Task Queue in `requirements/tasks/_index.md` with Status `draft`.

### Step 2.6 — PAUSE and present plan for user confirmation

**Mandatory stop.** Do not begin Stage 3 until the user explicitly confirms.

Present:

```
計畫完成 — 請確認後再開始實作。

Issue: <title> (#<n>)
Source spec: references/asgard-sdk-pm/<path>

Task Queue (新增):
| Task ID    | Title          | Complexity | Status |
|------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| BUILD-NNN  | <title>        | S/M/L      | draft  |
| REVIEW-NNN | Review: <...>  | —          | draft  |

Acceptance Criteria (BUILD-NNN):
- R1: When ..., the system shall ...
- R2: ...
- RN: (Smoke check) When the developer runs `npm run build:core && npm run build:react`
      and exercises <feature> in the react-demo (http://localhost:4200) / Vitest,
      the system shall <expected observable behavior> with no build errors.

有問題或需要調整（例如拆成多個 task、修改 R#）請告知。確認後我開始實作。
```

After user confirms, update BUILD-NNN.md Status: `draft → ready`. Update `_index.md` to `ready`. If no other task is currently `in-progress`, advance `## ▶ Next Task` to `BUILD-NNN`.

---

## Stage 3: Build

**Goal:** Implement per `FRONTEND_RULE_COMMON.md`; fill `## Coverage`; keep `_index.md` status current.

### On user go

1. Update `BUILD-NNN.md` Status: `ready → in-progress`. Update `_index.md`.
2. Read `.claude/skills/feature-workflow/FRONTEND_RULE_COMMON.md` in full before writing any code. The `## Relevant Rules` table in BUILD-NNN.md is a distilled reference, but the full corpus catches edge cases.
3. Work through `## Implementation Tasks` in order, checking off each `T#` as completed.
4. Implement per `FRONTEND_RULE_COMMON.md` §1–§7:
   - Types / enums in `packages/core/src/types` + `constants` before first use (§2.3)
   - Keep the package boundary: `@asgard-js/core` has no React/DOM deps; `@asgard-js/react` imports core via its public entry only (§1.6 / §2.1)
   - No `any`, no `@ts-ignore` / `eslint-disable` to bypass type errors (§1.1–§1.2)
   - Clean teardown for every RxJS subscription / EventSource / timer (§1.5)
   - Public API changes go through `@deprecated`, not removal (§1.7); export new API from the package entry (§2.2)
   - React components: typed props, theming via CSS variables (§4.1–§4.2)
5. Fill `## Coverage` in BUILD-NNN.md:
   - **Use Cases**: list R# identifiers satisfied (or `—` if purely structural with no behavioral validation)
   - **Files**: list every `.ts` / `.tsx` file created or modified (note the package)
6. Run static checks:

```bash
npm run lint:packages
npm run format:check
npm run build:core && npm run build:react
```

7. Smoke check: build core+react, then exercise the feature — run relevant Vitest, and/or `npm run serve:react-demo` (http://localhost:4200) and walk through all R# (e.g. `/templates`). Take a screenshot to `.github/screenshots/` if the change is visually significant.
8. Update `BUILD-NNN.md` Status: `in-progress → done`. Fill Execution Log. Update `_index.md`.
9. Update `REVIEW-NNN.md` Status: `draft → ready`. Update `_index.md`.

### Blocking rule

若 build 過程有需要人為判斷、且無法從 spec 或 `FRONTEND_RULE_COMMON.md` 決定的事項，立即停下來問，不要自行假設。

---

## Stage 4: Review

**Goal:** Run the review skill on `BUILD-NNN`; route findings back to build; loop until all findings pass.

### Step 4.1 — Invoke the review skill

```
/review BUILD-NNN
```

The review skill runs §1 Static Code Review and §3 Functional Validation (per `REVIEW_RULE.md`) and writes findings to `REVIEW-NNN.md`. It reads `BUILD-NNN.md ## Coverage` to determine scope.

註：若該 BUILD task 的 `Coverage.Use Cases` 為 `—`，review skill 會跳過 §3 功能驗收，REVIEW-NNN 仍可達 `done`。

### Step 4.2 — Route findings

On review skill completion:

- **Zero BLOCKERs** → proceed to Stage 5.
- **§1 violations** (static rule breach): fix each violation in source, re-run `npm run build:core && npm run build:react` + `npm run lint:packages`, then invoke the review skill again on `BUILD-NNN`.
- **§3 failures** (functional): describe [actual behavior] vs [expected behavior].
  - If fixable by implementation change → fix in source, re-run test / demo, invoke the review skill again.
  - If the gap requires a spec change or new R# → stop and ask the user before touching any file.

Repeat the loop until the review skill reports no BLOCKERs and marks `REVIEW-NNN` `done`.

---

## Stage 5: Done

**Goal:** Close the cycle only after explicit user authorization.

After the review skill marks REVIEW-NNN `done`:

1. Present summary:

```
Review 通過 — 等待授權完成此 cycle。

BUILD-NNN: <title> — done (§1 ✅ / §3 ✅)
REVIEW-NNN: done

確認後我更新 _index.md 並標記本 cycle 完成。
```

2. **Wait for explicit user authorization.**
3. On authorization: confirm both BUILD-NNN and REVIEW-NNN are `done` in `_index.md`. Advance `## ▶ Next Task` to the next `ready` task, or set to `None — awaiting task selection` if none remain.

---

## State and Status Rules

- **Mode**: always `spec-only`. No running design-reference server, no screenshot comparison against a reference build. The prototype at `references/asgard-chat-kit-prototype` is visual / behavioral background only.
- **Status flow**: `draft → ready → in-progress → done`
- **Forbidden status form**: never write `in_progress` (underscore). Always use `in-progress` (hyphen).
- The `Status` field in a task file and the matching row in `_index.md` Task Queue must always be in sync.

## When to Stop and Ask

| Situation                                                                                   | Stage |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| The tracking path is absent from the issue body and `find` returns nothing                  | 1     |
| The spec has no identifiable acceptance criteria or behavioral requirements                 | 1     |
| User requests task split / merge / R# change after seeing the plan                          | 2     |
| A build decision requires human judgment not covered by the spec or FRONTEND_RULE_COMMON.md | 3     |
| A §3 failure requires a spec change rather than an implementation fix                       | 4     |
| User has not yet explicitly authorized Done                                                 | 5     |
